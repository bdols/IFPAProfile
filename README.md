# IFPAProfile
use the IFPA API to query competitive pinball player stats and tournaments

To new developers: you'll need to request an API key from http://www.ifpapinball.com/api/documentation/
Once you have that, create a file called localapp.properties that contains the following:

    ifpa_api_key="<YOUR KEY HERE>"

This project can be built with Android Studio 2.1.1 and gradle 2.1.0
